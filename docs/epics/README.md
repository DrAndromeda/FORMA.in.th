# Epic files

**One proposal = one epic.** Don't split a single proposal into several
epics by phase/section — that just adds tracking overhead (more issues to
open, more links to keep straight) without adding clarity, since it's one
brief being built by the same team in the same sessions. Break the work
into **large tasks** instead (see `../tasks/README.md`) — each task should
represent a real work session's worth of doing, not a five-minute step.

If you're setting up this workflow for a second proposal later, that's a
second epic — but a single proposal should map to exactly one epic file
here, however big the proposal is.

## Format `scripts/create-epic-issues.sh` parses

```markdown
# Epic Title Here

**Priority:** P0
**Status:** In progress — see task breakdown below

Free-form spec content from here down — as long as you need. This is what
gets copied into the created issue's body, plus a link back to this file.
```

- **Line 1** (`# Title`) is **required** and is the exact-match key used for
  duplicate detection — `create-epic-issues.sh` skips creating an issue if one
  already exists with the exact title `[EPIC] <this title>`. Don't change an
  epic file's title after its issue has been created, or you'll get a
  duplicate on the next run.
- **`**Priority:**`** is optional. Must be exactly `P0`, `P1`, or `P2`.
- **`**Status:**`** is optional but is what `make board-sync-status` reads.
  Write it in plain English — the script maps it onto the board loosely:
  contains "not started" → Backlog; is (or contains) "Done" → Done;
  anything else ("Partial", "In progress", "Mostly done", ...) → In Progress.
  For the one epic, this is usually a summary/rollup — the real per-task
  status lives on each task.
- Everything else is free-form — write the actual spec, or (more likely,
  since it's one epic covering everything) a summary plus a table linking
  out to the task breakdown.

There's no `**Phase:**` field for epics anymore — with one epic per
proposal, "phase" doesn't distinguish anything at the epic level. Tasks can
still carry a `**Phase:**` line if the proposal has a numbered roadmap
worth preserving as a reference (see `../tasks/README.md`).

## Turning a proposal into an epic is a manual, human step

`scripts/create-epic-issues.sh` only turns an **already-written** file in
this directory into a GitHub Issue — it does not read the proposal itself,
and it does not decide how to summarize it. Write the epic file first
(one per proposal, using the template above), then run `make board-epics`.
