      'FORMA is based on Koh Phangan and designs, builds and supervises villas and interiors island-wide, working directly with the terrain, zoning and logistics specific to each district — from the quieter west coast to the developed south.',
    intro:
      'Koh Phangan rewards architecture that understands its terrain: steep interior hills, a coastline that shifts character from the busy south to the quiet, forested north-west, and a construction supply chain that runs through Surat Thani and Ko Samui before reaching site by boat or barge. We work across the island\'s districts, and this local presence shapes every recommendation we make, from realistic construction schedules around the monsoon to material choices that hold up to salt air and humidity without constant upkeep.',
    context:
      'The island is administratively part of Surat Thani province and has its own building and land-use considerations distinct from mainland Thailand. Plot characteristics vary enormously across a short distance — a flat beachfront lot in Thong Sala behaves nothing like a terraced hillside plot above Sri Thanu — so we treat each district\'s conditions as a distinct design input rather than applying one standard approach island-wide.',
    logistics:
      'Materials and equipment typically arrive via the mainland and are barged or ferried to the island, which means procurement lead times need realistic planning, particularly for imported finishes or heavy equipment. We sequence construction schedules around vessel availability and the wetter months of the monsoon season, building that logistics reality into the project programme from the outset rather than treating it as an unplanned delay.',
    faqs: [

    directAnswer:
      'Haad Salad\'s quieter, smaller beach and reef-adjacent waters attract owners seeking privacy and a more secluded villa setting. FORMA designs here with a focus on discreet massing, landscape integration and outlooks over the bay\'s calmer waters.',
    intro:
      'Haad Salad remains one of the island\'s quieter north-west beaches, its smaller scale and reef-sheltered waters appealing to owners who prioritise seclusion and a slower pace over proximity to the island\'s busier hubs. Villa design here tends to favour understated massing that sits comfortably within the bay\'s low-key character.',
    context:
      'Development density is lower here than in the island\'s southern districts, and much of our work involves discreet, landscape-integrated villas designed to feel private even on modest plot sizes.',
    logistics:
      'Access roads to Haad Salad are more limited than the island\'s main corridors, requiring realistic planning for delivery vehicle size and scheduling on some plots.',
    faqs: [
      {
        q: 'Is Haad Salad a good choice for privacy-focused villa design?',
        a: 'Yes, its quieter, lower-density setting is well suited to villas designed around seclusion and a slower pace of life.',
      },
      {
        q: 'What access considerations apply to construction here?',
        a: 'Access roads are more limited than the island\'s main corridors, so we plan delivery logistics specifically around each plot\'s access constraints.',
      },
      {
        q: 'Are landscape design and privacy planting common requests here?',
        a: 'Yes, landscape-led privacy strategies are a frequent part of villa briefs in this area, coordinated through our Landscape Design service.',
